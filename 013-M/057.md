# Flashloans can be used to manipulate pool tick

## Summary

GFX uses the Uniswap pool tick to determine the status of an order. The tick value can easily be manipulated if a user takes a flashloan and performs a large swap on the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

Malicious user can manipulate the tick and then deposit to what would otherwise be an ITM order. User can also use the manipulated tick to performUpkeep and create a claim for their position.

## Impact

User can bypass checks by manipulating the pool tick using a flashloan and large swap.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
OrderStatus status = _getOrderStatus(details.tick, details.lower, details.upper, direction);
// forbid orders that are "ITM". basically, if your order is through the market, then instead of limit order, you should swap
if (status != OrderStatus.OTM) revert LimitOrderRegistry__OrderITM(details.tick, targetTick, direction);
```
