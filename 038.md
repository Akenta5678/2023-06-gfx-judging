# Missing input validation allows adversary to get the owed amount for another user when claiming orders

## Summary

In LimitOrderRegistry.sol, there is claimOrder() function where the owed to the user amount is calculated and sent to the user afterwards. The problem is that it doesn't send anything to the msg.sender but the user specified in the parameters

## Vulnerability Detail

When claiming orders in LimitOrderRegistry, user can specify "batchId" and "user" parameters. However, it only checks the depositAmount like this and nothing else:

uint256 depositAmount = batchIdToUserDepositAmount[batchId][user];

After that, only owed amount is calculated based on the batchId and there is no any validation on how the batchId is related to the user specified in the parameters

## Impact

Users can lose their money because of missing validation

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation for the user parameter to make sure that batchId actually relates to the msg.sender
