# Heartbeat threshold is hardcoded

## Summary

An immutable heartbeat threshold might cause an incorrect staleness check leading to the wrong gas price being computed.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L229

```solidity
File: LimitOrderRegistry.sol
229:     uint256 public constant FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT = 7200;
..SNIP..
1447:     function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
1448:         // If gas feed is set use it.
1449:         if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
1450:             (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
1451:             uint256 timeSinceLastUpdate = block.timestamp - _timestamp;
1452:             // Check answer is not stale.
1453:             if (timeSinceLastUpdate > FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT) {
1454:                 // If answer is stale use owner set value.
1455:                 // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
1456:                 return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9;
1457:             } else {
1458:                 // Else use the datafeed value.
1459:                 uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
1460:                 return answer;
1461:             }
1462:         }
1463:         // Else use owner set value.
1464:         return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9; // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
1465:     }
```

Line 1453 in the above code checks if the value returned from the Chainlink gas feed is stale. If the time last update is larger than `FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT` (7200 seconds/ 2 hours), then the value is considered stale, and the owner set value will be used.

However, the `FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT` is hardcoded and immutable. This might be an issue because Chainlink's heartbeat value might be changed in the future. For instance, it might reduce the heartbeat to 3600 seconds (1 hour). If this happen, the existing code will fail to detect the stale value returned from the price feed.

In addition, as per the contest's README, the project is intended to be deployed on multiple L2 chains (Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum). At the moment, there is no fast gas price feed available on the L2 chains. However, if the fast gas price feed becomes available on L2 chains in the future, the heartbeat of those feeds might not be equal to 7200 seconds.

As mentioned by [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds):

> Heartbeat and deviation thresholds can also differ for the same asset across different blockchains. 

and existing observation that the heartbeat of price feed across different blockchains are often different (e.g. AAVE/USD on Ethereum - 1 hour heartbeat, AAVE/USD on Arbitrum - 24 hours heartbeat).

In this case, if the owner intended to add L2's fast gas price feed in the future, they will not be able to configure the `FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT` variable to a different value.

## Impact

Risk of incorrect staleness check leading to the wrong gas price being computed.

## Recommendation

Consider allowing the owner to update the heartbeat variable in the contract.
