# Round completeness is not checked in Chainlink's latestRoundData call, which may lead to stale gas prices

## Summary

Round completeness is not checked in Chainlink's latestRoundData call, which may lead to stale gas prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

When using Chainlink's `latestRoundData` function, there is no check for round completeness

According to Chainlink's documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or outdated round data. The external Chainlink oracle, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on third-party data sources. For example, the oracle could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the index price calculations. Oracle reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems, and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion.

```solidity
    function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
```

## Impact

Stale gas prices may be used.

## Recommendation
```solidity
 function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {

        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
+      (uint80 roundID , int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp,  uint80 answeredInRound) = 
          IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
+      require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
```
