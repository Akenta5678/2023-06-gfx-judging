# new upkeepGasLimit or maxFillsPerUpkeep in LimitOrderRegistry is not sync with the maxGasLimit in chainlink automation task for old pool

## Summary
new upkeepGasLimit or maxFillsPerUpkeep in LimitOrderRegistry is not sync with the maxGasLimit in chainlink automation task

## Vulnerability Detail
when a new UniswapV3 pool is registered through `setupLimitOrder`, the current `maxFillsPerUpkeep * upkeepGasLimit` is used for setting up the max gaslimit for the chainlink automation. However when the `upkeepGasLimit` or `maxFillsPerUpkeep` is updated by the owner, the old parameter is still being used for the old pool.

## Impact
latest max gaslimit related parameters is not in sync for chainlink automation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There is no easy fix for this issue since chainlink keeper does not have a straight-forward interface for updating configuration. One possible way is to cancel the task first, then re-request using the updated logic/parameter. The limitation is that each existing pool requires a separate call once an update is needed. This does not scale well as the size of the pool grows.

However it's important to sync (or have a way for the owner to sync) the new gas limit for past chainlink automation task, otherwise there is no way for the tradingMnager or external party to track the gas limit for a particular pool.
