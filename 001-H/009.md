# Owner can steal users WETH-ETH by setting gasPrice higher

## Summary
Owner can make a dummy chainlink interface contract to inflate the gas price to get more fees from users.
## Vulnerability Detail
When some positions are fulfilled by the performUpkeep call the fee is calculated as follows

`uint256 estimatedFee = uint256(upkeepGasLimit * getGasPrice());`

getGasPrice() function is also follows:

```solidity
function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
            uint256 timeSinceLastUpdate = block.timestamp - _timestamp;
            // Check answer is not stale.
            if (timeSinceLastUpdate > FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT) {
                // If answer is stale use owner set value.
                // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
                return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9;
            } else {
                // Else use the datafeed value.
                uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
                return answer;
            }
        }
        // Else use owner set value.
        return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9; // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
    }
```

From the above snippet we can say that if the fastGasFeed address is settable by owner, which is, any `_answer` can be returned. Owner can make a fake chainlink interfaced contract and returns the price and the timestamps as legit values such that the contract accepts them. Finally, the estimated fee will be calculated as abnormally high value hence, the owner can take an inflated fee amount from the users. Especially if the user is paying the gas via WETH and has a max approval, owner can take advantage of this and sets the gasPrice to something very high such that when the user claims the order, owner receives the entire balance of WETH that the user holds.
