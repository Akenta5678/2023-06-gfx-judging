# LimitOrderRegistry -> owenr can steal funds from user

## Summary
https://github.com/crispymangoes/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/blob/753974a4ba5b07ec076c5e5bcbe7277e5921be4b/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L505

In `withdrawNative()` function owner can withdraw all of the WETH token avaialable in contract 

## Vulnerability Detail

If users wants to create new order with `newOrder()` function based of any pool which contains WETH token and owner calls `withdrawNative()` function, owner drains all of the WETH available in contract this means users who created the order based of WETH as token out they cannot claim their order since there is nothing in the contract.

## Impact

owner calls `withdrawNative()` function and drain all of the WETH and user can't withdraw thier token out

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function withdrawNative() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 wrappedNativeBalance = WRAPPED_NATIVE.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 nativeBalance = address(this).balance;
        // Make sure there is something to withdraw.
        if (wrappedNativeBalance == 0 && nativeBalance == 0) revert LimitOrderRegistry__ZeroNativeBalance();

        // transfer wrappedNativeBalance if it exists
        if (wrappedNativeBalance > 0) WRAPPED_NATIVE.safeTransfer(owner, wrappedNativeBalance);
        // transfer nativeBalance if it exists
        if (nativeBalance > 0) owner.safeTransferETH(nativeBalance);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Owners should store their fee in a storage variable and withdraw the token based of the allowed amount in the variable not withdrawing all of the tokens
