# User's swapped LINK tokens might be lost

## Summary

Swapped LINK tokens stored in the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract that belong to the users and owner might be utilized or spent by Chainlink Automation, resulting in a loss of assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Unswap V3, there are several pools where one of the token pair consist of the Chainlink Link token. The following is a non-exhaustive list of pools that consists of LINK tokens with significant TVL (Data extracted from [Uniswap Info Page](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca)):

- [LINK / ETH (0.3% Fee)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xa6cc3c2531fdaa6ae1a3ca84c2855806728693e8) (TVL: $18.40 million)
- [RNG / LINK (0.3% Fee)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xec14a93206e8b17782370e43baaef63c048f1c3a) (TVL: $352.84k)
- [LINK / USDC (0.3% Fee)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xfad57d2039c21811c8f2b5d5b65308aa99d31559) (TVL: $336.73k)
- [UNI / LINK (0.3% Fee)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x9f178e86e42ddf2379cb3d2acf9ed67a1ed2550a) (TVL: $120.52k)

Note: I have verified that the LINK tokens in all the above-mentioned pools are the correct [ERC677 LINK](https://etherscan.io/address/0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA) token that Chainlink could utilize/spent in Ethereum.

The owner can support any UniswapV3 pool in the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract.

Assume that the LINK/ETH pool is supported. In this case, users can create a limit order that deposits ETH into the contract and purchase LINK when it reaches a specific price point (Order is ITM). When the order is ITM, it will be fulfilled, and LINK tokens will be sent and stored in the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract. Users must then call the `claimOrder` function to claim their swapped LINK tokens.

On the other hand, LINK tokens are also being deposited into the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract by the owner for the purpose of Chainlink Automation. Whenever the `performUpkeep` function is triggered by Chainlink Node, Chainklink will reduce the LINK balance in the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract as a fee.

The issue is that the user's swapped LINK tokens, including the owner's swap fee collected denominated in LINK, might be spent away by Chainlink Automation.

Assume Bob's order is fulfilled, and the pool sends 50 LINK tokens to the contract. If Bob claims the order immediately after his order is fulfilled, he should receive 50 LINK tokens back. However, Bob only claimed the order 1 month later. When he claimed the order 1 month later, only 10 LINK tokens were left in the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract because Chainlink Automation had reduced the LINK balance of the contracts as an upkeep/maintenance fee. In addition, the owner's bot is configured only to replenish the LINK tokens if it falls below 10 LINK.

As a result, Bob's 40 LINK tokens are lost and have been unauthorized spent. 

If even Bob decides to retrieve his remaining 10 LINK tokens by calling the `claimOrder` function, it is impossible because when the code at Line 724 below calls the `safeTransfer` function, it will attempt to transfer 50 LINK tokens that Bob is entitled to, which will revert due to insufficient assets.

```solidity
File: LimitOrderRegistry.sol
696:     function claimOrder(uint128 batchId, address user) external payable returns (ERC20, uint256) {
..SNIP..
721:         uint256 owed = (totalTokenOut * depositAmount) / totalTokenDeposited;
722: 
723:         // Transfer tokens owed to user.
724:         tokenOut.safeTransfer(user, owed);
```

When the owner attempts to collect their earned LINK swap, it might revert due to insufficient assets when Line 499 below is executed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L490

```solidity
File: LimitOrderRegistry.sol
490:     function withdrawSwapFees(address tokenFeeIsIn) external onlyOwner {
491:         uint256 fee = tokenToSwapFees[tokenFeeIsIn];
492: 
493:         // Make sure there are actually fees to withdraw;
494:         if (fee == 0) revert LimitOrderRegistry__ZeroFeesToWithdraw(tokenFeeIsIn);
495: 
496:         // set fees to 0
497:         tokenToSwapFees[tokenFeeIsIn] = 0;
498:         // transfer fees to the user
499:         ERC20(tokenFeeIsIn).safeTransfer(owner, fee);
500:     }
```

## Impact

Loss of assets (LINK) for the users and owners.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing one of the following solutions to mitigate the issue:

#### Solution 1 - Disallow pool that consists of LINK token

Explicitly disallow owner from adding Uniswap V3 pool that consists of LINK token into the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract

#### Solution 2 - Store the user's LINK token and Chainlink Automation's LINK token in separate contracts

Consider storing the user's LINK token and Chainlink Automation's LINK token in separate contracts. This will prevent any overlap and ensure that the LINK token cannot be unauthorized access by another party.
