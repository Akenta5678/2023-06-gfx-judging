# Users may not cancel their orders if order goes ITM and back to OTM

## Summary
An order (OTM) can go to ITM and back to OTM without keepers noticing. In this case, cancelling the OTM order is impossible.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an order is OTM it can go ITM and then back to OTM in a same block. Keepers are checking the checkUpkeep every block or so, they are not checking specific tx. If an order goes ITM and OTM back, there will be some fees accrued to that position in both assets. If the user tries to cancel the quote user will fail due to these lines
