# Contract operator lacks address-zero validations

## Summary

The LimitOrderRegistry contract has a vulnerability where certain functions lack address-zero checks for specific parameters. This issue can potentially result in lost funds and render the contract inoperable if any of these parameters are mistakenly set to the zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is presented in the constructor of the LimitOrderRegistry contract. The following parameters are not checked for the zero address:

- _owner
- _positionManager
- wrappedNative
- link
- _registrar
- _fastGasFeed

```solidity
constructor(
        address _owner,
        NonFungiblePositionManager _positionManager,
        ERC20 wrappedNative,
        LinkTokenInterface link,
        IKeeperRegistrar _registrar,
        address _fastGasFeed
    ) Owned(_owner) {
        POSITION_MANAGER = _positionManager;
        WRAPPED_NATIVE = wrappedNative;
        LINK = link;
        registrar = _registrar;
        fastGasFeed = _fastGasFeed;
    }
```

If any of these parameters are set to the zero address, it can lead to unintended behavior and potential loss of funds. The contract may become inoperable, as certain operations rely on these addresses.

## Impact

The failure to check for the zero address in these parameters can have severe consequences. It can result in the loss of funds and make the contract non-functional, affecting its intended operations.
