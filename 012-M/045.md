# Silent overflow can affect the collection of fees from the NonFungiblePositionManager

## Summary
Fees can get stuck in the NonFungiblePositionManager contract when calling the collect() because of how the fees to collect are computed when partial liquidity is removed

## Vulnerability Detail
After liquidity has been decreased from the LP Position in the NonFungiblePositionManager contract it is computed the amount of fees to collect based on the amount of tokens that were received.
- The problem is that the [received values are `uint256` and they are downcasted to `uint128` without implementing any safe check.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L1361-L1369)
  - If a silent overflow occurs when doing the downcast and not the whole liquidity was removed, [the amount of fees to collect will be set incorrectly and fees can get stuck on the NonFungiblePositionManager contract because of this.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L1379-L1400)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Make sure to validate that the [operation to downcast the received values from the POSITION_MANAGER.decreaseLiquidity()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L1361-L1369) won't cause a silent overflow, otherwise the amount of fees to collect will be set wrong.
```solidity
// Use a safe downcast function
function _safeUint128(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint128) {
    require(x <= uint256(type(uint128).max));
    return uint128(x);
}
```
