# latestRoundData without checking the L2 sequencer is offline

## Summary

The protocol will be deployed on the L2 network. There is a sequencer in arbitrum and optimism. When the sequencer goes offline, the oracle data will not be updated.
Note that this is not the same as freshness, because there are situations where the gas price data changes substantially, but the latest data is not updated because the sequencer is offline, and the old data used is still in the heartbeat range.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
            uint256 timeSinceLastUpdate = block.timestamp - _timestamp;
            // Check answer is not stale.
            if (timeSinceLastUpdate > FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT) {
                // If answer is stale use owner set value.
                // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
                return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9;
            } else {
                // Else use the datafeed value.
                uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
                return answer;
            }
        }
        // Else use owner set value.
        return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9; // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
    }
```

As you can see from the code here, the data is read directly without checking the sequencer state

## Impact

When the L2 sequencer goes offline, an inaccurate old price can be used
