# The oracle price update has a threshold, which is different from the actual price

## Summary

The chainlink oracle price update has a threshold, which is different from the actual price. Direct use of the oracle price may lead to inaccurate gasPrice calculations, and low charges may cause the protocol runs out of funds..

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
            uint256 timeSinceLastUpdate = block.timestamp - _timestamp;
            // Check answer is not stale.
            if (timeSinceLastUpdate > FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT) {
                // If answer is stale use owner set value.
                // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
                return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9;
            } else {
                // Else use the datafeed value.
                uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
                return answer;
            }
        }
        // Else use owner set value.
        return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9; // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
    }
```

When tx is executed over chainlink automation's network, the tokens stored in the app are consumed, and the protocol will charge the user a fee to compensate for the cost of maintaining the chainlink automation application. 
However, there is an update threshold for the oracle gas price. If the gas price is calculated directly using the oracle price, the actual gas price may be 0.5% higher than that of the actual, may cause the protocol runs out of funds.

## Impact

The inaccurate gas price can result in the protocol losing money

## Recommendation

Add 0.5% more than the value oracle returned
