# Solmate safeTransferLib.sol functions does not check the codesize of the token address, which may lead to fund loss

## Summary
Solmate safeTransferLib.sol functions does not check the codesize of the token address, which may lead to fund loss

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In LimitOrderRegistry.sol contract, Most of the functions have used the safeTransfer() and safeTransferFrom() doesn't check the existence of code at the token address. This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries.

Per the Solmate safeTransferLib.sol,

> Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! .....
 
Hence using safeTransferLib.sol library may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds , **because if safetransfer() and safetransferfrom() are called on a token address that doesn't have contract in it, it will always return success,** bypassing the return value check. Due to this protocol will think that funds has been transferred and successful , and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality funds were never transferred.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use openzeppelin's safeERC20 which takes care of token code existence.
