# a user has no way to cancel/withdraw an order that stays between lower/upper tick for a prolonged period of time in LimitOrderRegistry

## Summary
a user has no way to cancel/withdraw an order that stays between lower/upper tick for a prolonged period of time in LimitOrderRegistry.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently there are two ways for user to retrieve fund in the order management flow.
1. ClaimOrder
2. CancelOrder

ClaimOrder would get back the fully executed order, once the order turns from OTM (both lower and upper tick is beyond the currentTick), to ITM (where both lower and upper tick are within the currentTick, namely input fully turned into the other side).
This is done by the bot which does `DecreaseLiquidity` against the pool, retrieving a fully executed order and mark the fund `isReadyForClaim`.

CancelOrder, on the other hand, would allow a user to get back his/her original sent-in fund, provided the input is not touched, or the order is still in OTM state. 

However, if the order is in between, namely the currentTick is within the lower/upper tick, or the order is in a partially filled state, there is no way for the user to retrieve the fund, or get back the fund against it. This causes an issue since the user might have thought:

1. he/she configured a range that he/she thinks is too wide now.
2. The currentTick simply stays within the targeted range for a prolonged period of time.

At worst, there is also a chance that the user mis-configure, and send in a limit order that has maximal lower/upper range as possible, and he/she only realizes it after currentTick hits (the order becomes MIXED). In this case, he/she essentially lose access to the fund (imagine someone sends a limit order to buy ETH from $1 to $1949 (current price as of writing is $1950), or a limit order to sell ETH from $1951 to $100,000 for example.

## Impact
No way to withdraw fund when the order is "partially filled", namely the currentTick stays in between the targeted lower/upper tick. A user risks fund being stuck if the lower/upper tick is configured to be too wide, or simply the market price stays there.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Allow a MIXED order to be cancelled.
2. Remove the bipolar amount0 / amount1 non-zero checks on cancelOrder, such that a partially filled order can also be cancelled.

```solidity
...
---                if (status != OrderStatus.OTM) revert LimitOrderRegistry__OrderITM(tick, targetTick, direction);
+++               if (status != OrderStatus.OTM || status != OrderStatue.MIXED) revert LimitOrderRegistry__OrderITM(tick, targetTick, direction);
...
...
        if (order.direction) {
            if (amount0 > 0) poolToData[pool].token0.safeTransfer(sender, amount0);
---            else revert LimitOrderRegistry__NoLiquidityInOrder();
---            if (amount1 > 0) revert LimitOrderRegistry__AmountShouldBeZero();
+++         poolToData[pool].token1.safeTransfer(sender, amount1);
        } else {
            if (amount1 > 0) poolToData[pool].token1.safeTransfer(sender, amount1);
---            else revert LimitOrderRegistry__NoLiquidityInOrder();
---            if (amount0 > 0) revert LimitOrderRegistry__AmountShouldBeZero();
+++.         poolToData[pool].token0.safeTransfer(sender, amount0);
        }
```

Actually the snippet can be refactored to a transfer of both token0 and token1 for both directions, but leave as it is for easier diff.
