# If the request for registerUpkeep is set to pending status, the protocol functionality will be disabled.

## Summary
If the request for `registerUpkeep` is set to pending status, the protocol functionality will be disabled.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `registerUpkeep` function of Chainlink, it will determine whether to set the request as pending based on the configuration of the registrar. Additionally, only the owner of the registrar can approve pending requests.

https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/2_0/KeeperRegistrar2_0.sol#L371-L382
```solidity
    uint256 upkeepId;
    RegistrarConfig memory config = s_config;
    if (_shouldAutoApprove(config, sender)) {
      s_config.approvedCount = config.approvedCount + 1;

      upkeepId = _approve(params, hash);
    } else {
      uint96 newBalance = s_pendingRequests[hash].balance + params.amount;
      s_pendingRequests[hash] = PendingRequest({admin: params.adminAddress, balance: newBalance});
    }

    return upkeepId;
```

https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/2_0/KeeperRegistrar2_0.sol#L188-L219
```solidity
  ) external onlyOwner {
    PendingRequest memory request = s_pendingRequests[hash];
    if (request.admin == address(0)) {
      revert RequestNotFound();
    }
    bytes32 expectedHash = keccak256(abi.encode(upkeepContract, gasLimit, adminAddress, checkData, offchainConfig));
    if (hash != expectedHash) {
      revert HashMismatch();
    }
    delete s_pendingRequests[hash];
    _approve(
```

In the `setupLimitOrder` of GFX, there is no check whether the return value of `registerUpkeep` is 0.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L417-L428
```solidity
                ERC20(address(LINK)).safeApprove(address(registrar), initialUpkeepFunds);
                RegistrationParams memory params = RegistrationParams({
                    name: "Limit Order Registry",
                    encryptedEmail: abi.encode(0),
                    upkeepContract: address(this),
                    gasLimit: uint32(maxFillsPerUpkeep * upkeepGasLimit),
                    adminAddress: owner,
                    checkData: abi.encode(pool),
                    offchainConfig: abi.encode(0),
                    amount: uint96(initialUpkeepFunds)
                });
                registrar.registerUpkeep(params);
```

Therefore, even if the request enters the pending state, it can still be completed setup.
This may lead to the following scenarios:
1. Owner executes setUp, putting the request into pending status.
2. User creates an order.
3. The price has reached the user's target price, but the upkeep is still in a pending state, resulting in the automation not triggering properly and the transaction unable to be executed. The user has suffered losses.
## Impact
The order cannot be completed successfully, causing losses to the user.

## Recommendation
Check the return value of `registerUpkeep`, if it is 0 then revert.
