# Unhandled chainlink revert would lock price oracle access

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData() is used which could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. This could lead to permanent denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail

In LimitOrderRegistry.sol, getGasPrice()

```Solidity
File: src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol

1447    function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
1448        // If gas feed is set use it.
1449        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
1450            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();


              // Some code

```

The above functions makes use of Chainlink's latestRoundData() to get the latest price. However, there is no fallback logic to be executed when the access to the Chainlink data feed is denied by Chainlink's multisigs. Chainlink's multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will. Therefore, to prevent denial of service scenarios, it is recommended to query Chainlink price feeds using a defensive approach with Solidityâ€™s try/catch structure. In this way, if the call to the price feed fails, the caller contract is still in control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.

## Impact
Call to latestRoundData could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. This could lead to permanent denial of service.

## Recommendation
Surround the call to latestRoundData() with try/catch instead of calling it directly. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a fallback oracle or handle the error in any other suitable way.
