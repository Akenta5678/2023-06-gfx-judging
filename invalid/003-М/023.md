# Protocol doesn't collect fees as intented

## Summary
Protocol doesn't receive as they intent to when orders are fulfilled in performUpkeep. 
## Vulnerability Detail
When a users orders are in position, performUpkeep can be called to fulfill the ITM orders. When orders are fully fulfilled and the users are only receiving the capital that they provided. Example: If Alice deposited 1000USDC at some tick in OTM when the order fulfills Alice receives only the ETH that she bought. The fees will be claimable by the protocol owner.

Now, let's look at the following code snippet in the _takeFromPosition function:

```solidity
function _takeFromPosition(
        uint256 target,
        UniswapV3Pool pool,
        uint256 liquidityPercent,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal returns (uint128, uint128) {
        (, , , , , , , uint128 liquidity, , , , ) = POSITION_MANAGER.positions(target);
        liquidity = uint128(uint256(liquidity * liquidityPercent) / 1e18);

        // Create decrease liquidity params.
        // NB: because the amount0Min and amount1Min are 0 here, it is technically possible to front run this
        // that is probably okay, but it should be noted
        NonFungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams memory params = NonFungiblePositionManager
            .DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: target,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: deadline
            });

        // Decrease liquidity in pool.
        uint128 amount0;
        uint128 amount1;
        {
            // @audit a0 and a1 are principal + fees !
            (uint256 a0, uint256 a1) = POSITION_MANAGER.decreaseLiquidity(params);
            // downcast to uint128 since those are the units we use
            amount0 = uint128(a0);
            amount1 = uint128(a1);
        }

        // If completely closing position, then collect fees as well.
        NonFungiblePositionManager.CollectParams memory collectParams;
        {
            uint128 amount0Max;
            uint128 amount1Max;
            if (liquidityPercent == 1e18) {
                amount0Max = type(uint128).max;
                amount1Max = type(uint128).max;
            } else {
                // Otherwise only collect principal.
                amount0Max = amount0;
                amount1Max = amount1;
            }
            // Create fee collection params.
            collectParams = NonFungiblePositionManager.CollectParams({
                tokenId: target,
                recipient: address(this),
                amount0Max: amount0Max,
                amount1Max: amount1Max
            });
        }

        // Save token balances.
        ERC20 token0 = poolToData[pool].token0;
        ERC20 token1 = poolToData[pool].token1;
        // @audit this balances are the idle balances
        uint256 token0Balance = token0.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 token1Balance = token1.balanceOf(address(this));

        // Collect fees.
        // @audit both collect fees + the principal
        POSITION_MANAGER.collect(collectParams);

        // Save fees earned, take the total token amount out - the amount removed from liquidity to get the fees earned.
        uint128 token0Fees = uint128(token0.balanceOf(address(this)) - token0Balance) - amount0;
        uint128 token1Fees = uint128(token1.balanceOf(address(this)) - token1Balance) - amount1;
        // Save any swap fees.
        if (token0Fees > 0) tokenToSwapFees[address(token0)] += token0Fees;
        if (token1Fees > 0) tokenToSwapFees[address(token1)] += token1Fees;

        return (amount0, amount1);
    }
```

The assumption here in this code is that when decreaseLiquidity called, the return variables are belong the initial capital without the fees. However, when entire liquidity is removed from v3 position, the removed liquidity will also include the fees aswell. 

Example to demonstrate:

If a position has 1000USDC and 1000DAI in beginning and earns 10 DAI + 10 USDC as fee, when the full liquidity removed the return values will be (1010USDC,1010DAI). Fees included.

Protocol never receives the fees they intent to. 
## Impact
Since this is something that protocol team didn't know about, I'll label this as high because it is breaking the design.
