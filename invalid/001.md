# No checks if the price returned by the chainlink oracle is up to date which can lead to fetching incorrect gas price

## Summary

Possible loss of funds since there is no check to verify that the price returned by the chainlink oracle is up to date, which can lead to fetching incorrect gas price.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `estimatedFee` which is passed tot the function `_fulfillOrder` is fetched from `getGasPrice` function which uses Chainlink oracle to get the price. The problem is that `answer` and other returned values from oracle are not validated and the obtained price is directly used.

## Impact
Medium: Loss of funds for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this type of checks:

```solidity
`function getPriceFromChainlink(address base, address quote) internal view returns (uint256) {
    (uint80 roundID, int256 price, uint256 timestamp, uint256 updatedAt, )= registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
    require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
    require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
    require(price > 0, "invalid price");

    // Extend the decimals to 1e18.
    return uint256(price) * 10 ** (18 - uint256(registry.decimals(base, quote)));
}`
```
