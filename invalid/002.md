# LimitOrderRegistry.getGasPrice() might return incorrect results

## Summary

The function `getGasPrice()` in the `LimitOrderRegistry` contract has a vulnerability where the return value of  `ChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData()` is not adequately validated, potentially resulting in incorrect gas price calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the code snippet provided, the function `getGasPrice()` retrieves the latest round data from a Chainlink aggregator contract. However, it does not validate if the value of `_answer` is positive before casting it to a `uint256` value. If `_answer` is negative, the casting operation can result in a large `uint256` value, leading to an inflated gas price.

```solidity
function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        ...
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
            ...
                // Else use the datafeed value.
                uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
                return answer;
            ...
    }
```

## Impact

The incorrect gas price calculation can result in a high estimated gas fee for users, potentially causing them to pay more than necessary for their transactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to add a validation check to ensure that `_answer` is greater than zero before casting it to a `uint256` value. The following code snippet demonstrates the recommended change:

```solidity
	(, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
+	require(_answer > 0, "Chainlink _answer <= 0");
```
