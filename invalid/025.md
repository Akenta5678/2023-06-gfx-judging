# If the token has 0-2 decimals user can get sandwitched

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the contract should be adaptable with every univ3 tokens, there is an edge case with the 2 decimal tokens. When liquidity is added to the position the minimumOut is calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint128 amount0Min = amount0 == 0 ? 0 : (amount0 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;
uint128 amount1Min = amount1 == 0 ? 0 : (amount1 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;
```

if the token0 has 2 decimals and users adds liquidity with that token with an amount0 of 1000 (10 tokens with 2 decimal precision),  amount0Min will be calculated as 0 due to division truncates the result towards zero. If the amount0Min is 0 Sandwitch attack threads will be viable for this operation.
