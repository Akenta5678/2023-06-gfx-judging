# The slippage in `_mintPosition` and `_addToPosition` is hardcoded and too strict which may lead to the protocol being unusable even in low volatility periods

## Summary
The function that increases the liquidity into a UniswapV3 pool uses a hardcoded value of slippage which is set to 0.01% of the amount which can be too low most of the time.
## Vulnerability Detail
The functions that creates new positions or increase the liquidity of a position are `_mintPosition` and `_addToPosition` , both of them calculates the `amount0Min`/`amount1Min` as a hardcoded value, being 99.91% of the `amount0`/`amount1` values https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L1226-L1227

This can have multiple implication but the most important one would be that this slippage value can be too low for most of the pools so any interaction with any of the UniswapV3 pools could not work or revert most of the time, even in some low volatility periods where the values of the pools could change by a little. Consider the fact that even UniswapV3 states that if you use slippage values lower than 0.05% the transaction may revert, their default slippage tolerance being 0.1%.
## Impact
This would have a medium impact since the protocol can be unusable multiple times because of how strict the slippage is.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are different ways to solve this.

The first one is to let users determine the maximum slippage they're willing to take, the protocol front-end should set the recommended value for them or the second one is have a slippage control parameters that's set by the owner that can be changed anytime. Personally I would suggest the first one since the second one require another person instead of the user.
