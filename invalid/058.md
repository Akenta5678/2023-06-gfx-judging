# _mintPosition amountMin slippage is too low may revert

## Summary

_mintPosition amountMin is a hard-coded number 99.99%, the slippage is too low to easily make the transaction revert, the user experience is too poor, and can not be changed.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        // 0.9999e4 accounts for rounding errors in the Uniswap V3 protocol.
        uint128 amount0Min = amount0 == 0 ? 0 : (amount0 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;
        uint128 amount1Min = amount1 == 0 ? 0 : (amount1 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;
```

There are accuracy issues when calculating liquidity in uniswap, which may exceed the slippage and cause the transaction revert.

## Impact

The slippage is too low to easily make the transaction revert and the user experience is poor
