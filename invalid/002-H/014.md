# In performUpkeep, currentTick should be reacquired after _fulfillOrder.

## Summary
In `performUpkeep`, `currentTick` should be reacquired after `_fulfillOrder`.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `performUpkeep`, `currentTick` is obtained outside the loop, meaning that multiple `orderStatus` checks are based on the same tick.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L927-L938
```solidity
        (, int24 currentTick, , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
        bool orderFilled;

        // Fulfill orders.
        uint256 target = walkDirection ? data.centerHead : data.centerTail;
        for (uint256 i; i < maxFillsPerUpkeep; ++i) {
            if (target == 0) break;
            BatchOrder storage order = orderBook[target];
            OrderStatus status = _getOrderStatus(currentTick, order.tickLower, order.tickUpper, order.direction);
            if (status == OrderStatus.ITM) {
                _fulfillOrder(target, pool, order, estimatedFee, deadline);
```

In `_fulfillOrder`, the operations of removing liquidity and collecting fees are performed, which will affect the price of the current pool, that is, it will affect the value of slot0.

Therefore, `currentTick` may change after `_fulfillOrder`, thereby affecting `orderStatus`, but the same `currentTick` is always used in this function.
## Impact
The order that does not meet the tick requirements was executed, which affected the core functionality of the protocol.

## Recommendation
In `performUpkeep`, `currentTick` should be reacquired after `_fulfillOrder`.
