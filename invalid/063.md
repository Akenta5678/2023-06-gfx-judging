# DecreasingLiquidity has no slippage which may lead to undesirable returns of tokens

## Summary

The protocol has function that calls `decreaseLiquidity` in Uniswap's NonFungiblePositionManager. The lack of slippage check when decreasing the liquidity may lead to undesired returns of token0 and token1.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `_takeFromPosition()` which is called by `_fulfillOrder()` -> `performUpkeep()`, the parameters of `_takeFromPosition()` are called as such:

```solidity
        (amount0, amount1) = _takeFromPosition(target, pool, 1e18, deadline);
```

These parameters are passed into the params of `decreaseLiquidity`. Note that `liquiditPercent` is 1e18, meaning that the function intends to withdraw the whole liquidity position of the NFT. In the params, note that `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` is set to 0.

```solidity
    function _takeFromPosition(
        uint256 target,
        UniswapV3Pool pool,
        uint256 liquidityPercent,
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal returns (uint128, uint128) {
        (, , , , , , , uint128 liquidity, , , , ) = POSITION_MANAGER.positions(target);
>      liquidity = uint128(uint256(liquidity * liquidityPercent) / 1e18);
        NonFungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams memory params = NonFungiblePositionManager
            .DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: target,
                liquidity: liquidity,
>               amount0Min: 0,
>               amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: deadline
            });


        // Decrease liquidity in pool.
        uint128 amount0;
        uint128 amount1;
        {
>           (uint256 a0, uint256 a1) = POSITION_MANAGER.decreaseLiquidity(params);
            // downcast to uint128 since those are the units we use
            amount0 = uint128(a0);
            amount1 = uint128(a1);
        }
```

In UniswapV3, the documentation states that:

> In production, amount0Min and amount1Min should be adjusted to create slippage protections.

Docs: https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/providing-liquidity/decrease-liquidity

## Impact

If `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` is set to zero, the resulting value of `a0` and `a1` may be much lesser due to a lack of slippage protection, which means that there would be an unnecessary loss of position value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend adding the parameters `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` in the checks, like how `IncreaseLiquidity` is done.

```solidity
        NonFungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams memory params = NonFungiblePositionManager
            .IncreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: positionId,
                amount0Desired: amount0,
                amount1Desired: amount1,
>               amount0Min: amount0Min,
>               amount1Min: amount1Min,
                deadline: deadline
            });
```
