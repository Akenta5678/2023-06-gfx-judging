# Invisible stop order can frontrun already placed limit order with slightly better price, thus lowering chance of limit order being fulfilled.

## Summary
Let's say that user A created limit order to sell WETH at 2000 USDC.
user B has created stop order to sell WETH at 1999 USDC, but this stop order is not visible to the market and only fulfilled by the bot that monitors current price. 

When WETH' price keeps rising above 1990, then stop order fulfillment bot will create an limit order at 1999 by overriding user A's limit order with slightly better price.
As Chainlink automation keeper can process only 20 orders at one epch, user B's order get processed first and user A might have missed opportunity to fulfill its order.

Accidently price crashes to 1990 at next block.
user A have to wait another bullish moment to fulfill his order.
When user B has benefitted by fulling his stop order at the expense of user B.

## Vulnerability Detail
To fulfill orders, `performUpkeep()` start searching from centerHead or centerTail, which is last processed tick.

```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external {
    ...

  uint256 target = walkDirection ? data.centerHead : data.centerTail;
  ...

  for (uint256 i; i < maxFillsPerUpkeep; ++i) {
    if (target == 0) break;
    BatchOrder storage order = orderBook[target];
    ...
```

It will make most eligible order based on currentTick not to be processed first.

## Impact
Stop order creator might prevent limit order to be fulfilled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Searching linked list should start from currentTick, rather than from centerHead and centerTail, which is last processed tick.

```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external {
    ...

-     uint256 target = walkDirection ? data.centerHead : data.centerTail;
+    (uint256 head, uint256 tail) = _findSpot(pool, 0, currentTick, direction);
+    uint256 target = walkDirection ? head : tail;
  ...

  for (uint256 i; i < maxFillsPerUpkeep; ++i) {
    if (target == 0) break;
    BatchOrder storage order = orderBook[target];
    ...
```
