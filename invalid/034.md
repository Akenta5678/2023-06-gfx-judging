# safeTransferETH function has incorrect parameters

## Summary

In LimitOrderRegistry.sol, safeTransferETH is used multiple times but it doesn't have "to" parameter specified.

## Vulnerability Detail

Solmate SafeTransferLib library has internal safeTransferETH() function with "to" and "value" parameters. However, in the LimitOrderRegistry, safeTransferETH() doesn't have different implementation so it uses the basic one. That means that function doesn't work as it should be as "to" is not specified

## Impact

The funds will not be transferred to address(this) as it's not specified as "to" when using safeTransferETH()

## Code Snippet
