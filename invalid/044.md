# Decreasing liquidity from an LP Position is suceptible to a sandwich attack which could lead to users receiving less tokens than what they should because there is no slippage protection

## Summary
The parameters used to decrease liquidity from LP Positions in the NonFungiblePositionManager contract diasbles the [slippage protection that is built-in the NonfungiblePositionManager contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L275) because `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` are sent as 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
A certain percentage of liquidity from the LP Position is decreased each time an Order is Cancelled or Fullfiled but there is no slippage protection to prevent Liquidity Providers from receiving less tokens than what they really should receive. The issue is caused because the variables [`amount0Min` and `amount1Min` are sent as 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L1356-L1357). of the parameters that are sent to the [NonFungiblePositionManager:decreaseLiquidity()](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L257-L306)
```solidity
function _takeFromPosition(
      uint256 target,
      UniswapV3Pool pool,
      uint256 liquidityPercent,
      uint256 deadline
  ) internal returns (uint128, uint128) {
      ...

      NonFungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams memory params = NonFungiblePositionManager
          .DecreaseLiquidityParams({
              tokenId: target,
              liquidity: liquidity,
              //@audit-issue => Will disable the slippage protection that is built-in the NonFungiblePositionManager:decreaseLiquidity() function
              amount0Min: 0,
              amount1Min: 0,
              deadline: deadline
          });

      ...
  }
```

Attackers can manipulate the price of ticks with not huge amounts of liquidity
- The `LimitOrderRegistry::_takeFromPosition()` calls the `NonFungiblePositionManager::decreaseLiquidity()`, and internally in the NonFungiblePositionManager contract, the process to actually decrease the liquidity is as follows:
  - The [`NonFungiblePositionManager::decreaseLiquidity()`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L257-L306) calls the [`UniswapV3Pool::burn()`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L517-L543) which internally calls the [`UniswapV3Pool:_modifyPosition()`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L306-L372), finally in this function it computes the amount of either `token0` or `token1` that will be given to the user for decresing a certain liquidity.
    - When the execution comes back to the `NonFungiblePositionManager::decreaseLiquidity()`, it will run [this check to prevent slippage](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L275), but because `params.amount0Min` and `params.amount1Min` were sent as 0, that check is basically useless and will allow to receive any amount of tokens (yes, even 0).

## Impact
Users can lose tokens because of sandwich attacks when Cancelling their orders or when their orders are fullfiled because the slippage protection mechanism that is built-in the `NonFungiblePositionManager::decreaseLiquidity()` is disabled due to incorrectly sending the arguments `params.amount0Min` and `params.amount1Min` set to 0.

## Tool used
Manual Review & [NonfungiblePositionManager UniswapV3 Contract](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol)

## Recommendation
- Instead of sending the arguments `params.amount0Min` and `params.amount1Min` set to 0, make sure to implement a mechanism that allows the contract to compute a minimum amount of tokens to receive after decreasing the liquidity from the LP Position, otherwise, user's funds are at risk .
