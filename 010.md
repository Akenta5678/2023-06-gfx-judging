# ClaimOrder function incorrectly calculates owed amount

## Summary
the `claimOrder` function where the   `owed`  is calculates, could result a potential for integer overflow or underflow in the `claimOrder` function
## Vulnerability Detail
the `claimOrder` function where the   `owed`  is calculates, the calculation of owed is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the depositAmount parameter may be greater than the total amount of liquidity that was deposited for the order
```solidity
// Calculate owed amount.
        uint256 totalTokenDeposited;
        uint256 totalTokenOut;
        ERC20 tokenOut;

        // again, remembering that direction == true means that the input token is token0.
        if (userClaim.direction) {
            totalTokenDeposited = userClaim.token0Amount;
            totalTokenOut = userClaim.token1Amount;
            tokenOut = poolToData[userClaim.pool].token1;
        } else {
            totalTokenDeposited = userClaim.token1Amount;
            totalTokenOut = userClaim.token0Amount;
            tokenOut = poolToData[userClaim.pool].token0;
        }

        uint256 owed = (totalTokenOut * depositAmount) / totalTokenDeposited;
```
ensure that the division operation does not result in any unintended truncation or rounding errors. Depending on the token amounts involved, precision loss could occur.
## Impact
-could result a potential for integer overflow or underflow in the `claimOrder` function

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- use a precise arithmetic library or consider using fixed-point arithmetic to perform the calculation with the desired precision
