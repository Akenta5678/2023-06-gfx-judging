# Hard-coded slippage may lead to DOS during slight market turbulence

## Summary

Extremely strict Hardcoded slippage can potentially lead to permanent DOS for placing a new order.

## Vulnerability Detail

The idea of setting slippage is to protect the user from getting less tokens than they wanted due to high volatility and stop them from being exploited by MEV bots.

While placing a new Order, in case if the position id doesn't exist,  new LP position has been created through `_mintPosition` method. Even in case of already existed position id, the new order position is added to the existing position through `_addToPosition` method.

Issue arises is in strict hardcoded slippage in both this methods. In case of slight turbulance in pool, this extremely strict hardcoded slippage will force the function to revert everytime which can lead to DOS for users for longer time.

```solidity
File: LimitOrderRegistry.sol

`_mintPosition` Function:

  // 0.9999e4 accounts for rounding errors in the Uniswap V3 protocol.
  uint128 amount0Min = amount0 == 0 ? 0 : (amount0 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;
  uint128 amount1Min = amount1 == 0 ? 0 : (amount1 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;

```

```solidity
File: LimitOrderRegistry.sol

`_addToPosition` Function:

  uint128 amount0Min = amount0 == 0 ? 0 : (amount0 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;
  uint128 amount1Min = amount1 == 0 ? 0 : (amount1 * 0.9999e4) / 1e4;

## Impact

DOS in main functionality

## Code Snippet

Added above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would recommend you to let users determine the maximum slippage theyâ€™re willing to take through function parameter to avoid this situation.
