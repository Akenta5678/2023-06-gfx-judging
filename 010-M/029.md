# performUpkeep has a upkeep fee depletion problem if any claim reverts due to fee too little

## Summary
performUpkeep has a upkeep fee depletion problem if any claim reverts due to fee too little

## Vulnerability Detail
TradeManager has a registration on chainlink bot if the user desires to set it up by setting initialUpkeepFunds to non-zero value during initialise. The bot works by keep hitting `checkUpkeep` in the contract, and if the first bool is `true`, then it would call `performUpkeep`.

The logic in both checkUpkeep and performUpkeep rely on `isOrderReadyForClaim`, which is consistent. Once performUpkeep is done successfully, checkUpkeep would return `false` during a normal workflow. 

However, when performUpkeep does not pass through due to gas being too little, the transaction would revert. Since Chainlink bot is not responsible for a reverting tx when the signal is correct (namely checkUpkeep is returning `true`), thus the bot could still deduce Upkeep fee from the account. 


## Impact
1 reverting claim in the claim set due to fee too little would completely depletes all upkeep fee since bot would keep calling `performUpkeep` and revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a bool `performUpkeepFailed` on checkUpkeep such that if a performUpkeep fails once, the signal turns into false and becomes unactionable since it would yield the same reverting result unless there are system changes like gasPrice change(s) in the limitOrderRegistry; the upkeep should be bricked anyway before the user intervenes.

```solidity
function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata) external view returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData) {
     if(performUpkeepFailed)  {
             upkeepNeeded = false;
             return;
}
```

add a setter for user to toggle `performUpkeepFailed`.
