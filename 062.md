# Need to revalidate `performUpkeep()`

## Summary

When `checkUpkeep` returns `upkeepNeeded == true`, the Automation node broadcasts a transaction to the blockchain to execute your `performUpkeep` function on-chain with `performData` as an input.
To make sure everything is accurate, we need always [revalidate](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/compatible-contract-best-practice#revalidate-performupkeep-on-automation-compatible-contracts) conditions for upkeep at the start of `performUpkeep` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink suggests revalidating data in `performUpkeep` even if you are using a trusted Oracle solution like Chainlink Keepers. This is because `performUpkeep` is typically an external function that can be called by anyone, so it's necessary to ensure that its execution cannot lead to unwanted behavior or potential exploits in your contract.

One check we can do is on `deadline`. Check if it is in the desired range.

Another idea that occurs to me is to output `walkDirection` to a global variable and check if `walkDirection` from `performUpkeep()` matches the original.

According to Chainlink:

>It is undesirable for the state change to occur until the next time the Upkeep is checked by the network and the conditions are met. It is a best practice to stop any state change or effects by performing the same checks or similar checks that you use in `checkUpkeep`. These checks validate the conditions before doing the work.

## Impact

If the `performUpkeep` function isn't revalidated it may lead to unwanted outcomes.
