# feePerUser calculation has precision error resulting in low protocol income

## Summary

When calculating the amount of feePerUser, you should round up instead of down, which will result in lower protocol income, and the larger the number of people, the larger the difference.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
newClaim.feePerUser = uint128(estimatedFee / totalUsers);
```

There is a precision error in division here, and when rounding is taken into account, the protocol should take precedence over user experience.
For each person, the accuracy error is only 1 wei, but for the protocol, 1000 people is 1000 wei. Especially considering the maturity of the subsequent protocol and the increase of users and interactions, the greater the impact of the error on the income of the protocol.
In particular, this part of the cost may be for the maintenance of chainlink automation application, low income may lead to run out of funds, unable to maintain the normal operation of the protocol.
