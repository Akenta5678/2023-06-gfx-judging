# The protocol would not work with BNB like coins that revert on 0 values, even if it is stated that it should work with any coin traded on UniswapV3

## Summary
`LimitOrderRegistry.sol` checks after every interaction with the `POSITION_MANAGER` if the allowance is greater than 0 and approves to 0 if that's the case but in the case of BNB this would revert all the time.
## Vulnerability Detail
BNB on ethereum mainnet reverts on every function if the value provided is 0, as you can see here https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52#code#L94 so if the protocol intends to interact with BNB, a token which is supported on UniswapV3 and has a high market cap, this would revert because of how the protocol tries to approve to 0 after `IncreaseLiquidityParams` or `mint` called on `POSITION_MANAGER`.
## Impact
This would have medium impact since some tokens supported on UniswapV3 would not be able to interact with the protocol as it was stated

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The easiest way to solve this problem would be to use the `SafeERC20.sol` from OpenZeppelin instead of `SafeTransferLib` from solmate since the big difference between this two is the fact that the safe approve functions from OpenZeppelin always approves to 0, in the case where normal approve reverts so it will solve the problem with tokens that have the Race Condition check into their approve function like USDT https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/996168f1f114645b01a1c2e6909c9d98ec451203/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L79-L82, so if you use the OpenZeppelin version there is no need to check the allowances after.
