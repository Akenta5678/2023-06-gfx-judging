# Gas limit and gas price is not operable with L2's

## Summary
Constant gas limit and gas price are not operable with L2's.
## Vulnerability Detail
Max gas limit and gas price are hardcoded as constants in the contracts bytecode meaning that they can't change. However, these values are not operable with Arbitrum.

as noticed, the gas limit higher than the contracts constant values.
