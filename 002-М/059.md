# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary

Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Vulnerability Detail

It has been made clear that `LimitOrderRegistry` contract will be deployed on L2s like arbitrum as well,

Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active

Link: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds

If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.

## Impact

Price used might be stale and Users are charged wrongly.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: LimitOrderRegisty.sol

  function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
            uint256 timeSinceLastUpdate = block.timestamp - _timestamp;
            // Check answer is not stale.
            if (timeSinceLastUpdate > FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT) {
                // If answer is stale use owner set value.
                // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
                return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9;
            } else {
                // Else use the datafeed value.
                uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
                return answer;
            }
        }
        // Else use owner set value.
        return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9; // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
