# `_takeFromPosition` doesn't use any slippage protection for the `decreaseLiquidity` which could cause the users getting less funds then intended

## Summary
The protocol doesn't use any slippage protection in `_takeFromPosition` which could lead to loss of funds/user getting way less funds than expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol states in the comments that because of the fact that `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` are 0 here the function can be possible front-run but that is probably ok https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-gfx/blob/main/uniswap-v3-limit-orders/src/LimitOrderRegistry.sol#L1349-L1351
but I want to argue the fact that this is not ok giving two different exemples/cases.
- firstly the slippage is an important factor for users that wants to mint/burn shares so they can protect themselves against sandwich attacks and high volatility price movements, consider the fact that the protocol intends to work with any ERC20 token and pool that is supported by UniswapV3 and there are pools that have lower liquidity and can be easily manipulated
- secondly the protocol is intended to be deployed and worked also on L2 chains like Arbitrum or Optimism, chains that unlike mainnet ethereum, can be in a network downtime since stuff like The Sequencer on Arbitrum can be down. In that case, it is stated in the Uniswap support page that : *No swaps will be executed* , *No fees will be earned* and *No transactions will be possible. In particular, LPs will be unable to add liquidity, remove liquidity, claim fees, adjust price range, etc.* as can be seen here https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/7425219666061-How-to-provide-liquidity-on-Arbitrum. It is also stated that *when the network goes live again, LPs may experience sudden price movements if L1 market prices shifted while Arbitrum was down.* which means that if there is no slippage protection users may get way less assets than intended which would occur losses of funds for the user without them knowing
## Impact
This is a high impact since the user can lose funds and can't really protect themselves against it since they can set any slippage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Let the user specify the `amount0Min`/`amount1Min` so they can protect themselves instead of hardcoding the slippage or setting it to 0.
