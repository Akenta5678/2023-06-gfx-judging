# Users can frontrun custom gas feed prices to pay lower fees

## Summary

In the contract, the owner can set the `upkeepGasPrice`, and the original value is 30, which is 30 gwei. If the protocol only uses custom gas feed and the gwei goes up to 100 in the next block, users can frontrun the owner's change of `upkeepGasPrice` to 100 and pay only 30 gwei for their fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `getGasPrice()` gets the current gas price, in gwei, of the network.

```solidity
    function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
            uint256 timeSinceLastUpdate = block.timestamp - _timestamp;
            // Check answer is not stale.
            if (timeSinceLastUpdate > FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT) {
                // If answer is stale use owner set value.
                // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
@>              return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9;
            } else {
                // Else use the datafeed value.
                uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
                return answer;
            }
        }
        // Else use owner set value.
@>      return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9; // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
    }
```

If the chainlink aggregator is not set, ie `fastGasFeed` is set to zero, or the aggregator returns a stale timestamp, the function will return `upkeepGasPrice` * 1e9, which is the custom gwei setting. 

The function `getGasPrice` is used to estimate the fee for the user, and the value of `estimatedFee` is used in `_fulfillOrder`.

```solidity
        uint256 estimatedFee = uint256(upkeepGasLimit * getGasPrice());
                _fulfillOrder(target, pool, order, estimatedFee, deadline);
```

`estimatedFee` is then divided by `totalUsers` and stored in `newClaim.feePerUser`. 

```solidity
        newClaim.feePerUser = uint128(estimatedFee / totalUsers);
```

If the chainlink aggregator is not used or the chainlink aggregator's timestamp is stale, then the custom gas fee will be used instead. If there is a spike in the network fee, the user can capitulate on that spike and pay a lesser fee by frontrunning the owner's change of gwei.


## Impact

Users can pay a lesser gas fee.

## Recommendation

Reccomend relying on external oracles to get the gas price instead of using a custom gas price because it would be hard to keep track of every spike in the protocol. If the external oracle is down, have a backup oracle and ultimately revert the transaction if all else fails instead of relying on custom gas prices. 

```solidity
    function getGasPrice() public view returns (uint256) {
        // If gas feed is set use it.
        if (fastGasFeed != address(0)) {
            (, int256 _answer, , uint256 _timestamp, ) = IChainlinkAggregator(fastGasFeed).latestRoundData();
            uint256 timeSinceLastUpdate = block.timestamp - _timestamp;
            // Check answer is not stale.
            if (timeSinceLastUpdate > FAST_GAS_HEARTBEAT) {
                // If answer is stale use owner set value.
                // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
                return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9;
            } else {
                // Else use the datafeed value.
                uint256 answer = uint256(_answer);
                return answer;
            }
        }
        // Else use owner set value.
-       return uint256(upkeepGasPrice) * 1e9; // Multiply by 1e9 to convert gas price to gwei
    }
```
