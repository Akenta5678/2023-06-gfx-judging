# New orders can be created without chainlink upkeep job

## Summary
The addition of a new pool can lead to premature order creation because the process doesn't wait for keeper registration confirmation. This could result in a shortage of chainlink keepers, causing potential issues for users creating orders immediately after a new pool is registered.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the scenario where a new pool is added to our system. As part of this process, a new upkeep job is also created in the Keeper Registry. However, this procedure isn't instantaneous. When the registerUpkeep function is invoked, the request is initially set to 'pending' status, and it requires approval from the registrar owner to finalize the upkeep registration.

The twist here is that the current code allows users to place orders as soon as the new pool is added to the LimitOrderRegistry contract, even without waiting for the keeper registrar's approval. Consequently, any users who rush to create new orders immediately after a new pool is registered could face an unexpected shortage of Chainlink keepers. This is not in line with the desired behavior outlined in the contract's business logic.
