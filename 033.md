# > instead of >= should be used when refunding in LimitOrderRegistry

## Summary

In LimitOrderRegistry.sol, there is claimOrder() function in the end of which user can get the refund if his msg.value >= userClaim.feePerUser. Instead, > sign should be used

## Vulnerability Detail

claimOrder() function allows a user to claim their tokens once their limit order has been fulfilled. Additionally, the users can get their refund if msg.value sent >= userClaim.feePerUser. However, >= doesn't make any sense as it will always revert after due to the subsequent checks (refund will be 0 if msg.value == userClaim.feePerUser and refund will never be > 0 so it doesn't make any sense to check for >=) 

## Impact

The function will always revert if msg.value == userClaim.feePerUser
