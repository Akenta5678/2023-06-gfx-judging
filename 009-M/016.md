# Users can claim zero assets due to decimal differences between pool tokens

## Summary
Divison rounding can make the users claimable amount "0".
## Vulnerability Detail
When an user claims the fulfilled order, the amount they can claim is calculated as follows:

`uint256 owed = (totalTokenOut * depositAmount) / totalTokenDeposited;`

whereas, depositAmount and totalTokenDeposited is in terms of tokenX and totalTokenOut is in terms of tokenY

Assume that the tokenX has 18 decimals and tokenY has 2 decimals. 

Assume totalTokenDeposited is 100M X tokens, 10**26
Assume users depositAmount is 10K X tokens, 10**22
Assume totalTokenOut is 10 Y token, 10**3


according to formula user gets 10**3 * 10**22 / 10**26 = 0, because solidity works with integer roundings. 
## Impact
Since the protocol should work with any Uniswap pool tokens, these tokens can have decimals like 0-2-4-6-8-11-18 and in case of a pair where there is a decimal difference this scenario is very likely to happen.
