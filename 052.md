# Fulfillment of ITM orders can be DOSed by large number of orders

## Summary

An attacker could create a large number of orders causing legitimate ITM orders not being able to be fulfilled, leading to loss of assets and opportunity cost for the users.

```solidity
File: LimitOrderRegistry.sol
914:     function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external {
..SNIP..
930:         // Fulfill orders.
931:         uint256 target = walkDirection ? data.centerHead : data.centerTail;
932:         for (uint256 i; i < maxFillsPerUpkeep; ++i) {
933:             if (target == 0) break;
934:             BatchOrder storage order = orderBook[target];
935:             OrderStatus status = _getOrderStatus(currentTick, order.tickLower, order.tickUpper, order.direction);
936:             if (status == OrderStatus.ITM) {
937:                 _fulfillOrder(target, pool, order, estimatedFee, deadline);
938:                 target = walkDirection ? order.head : order.tail;
939:                 // Reconnect List and Zero out orders head and tail values removing order from the list.
940:                 orderBook[order.tail].head = order.head;
941:                 orderBook[order.head].tail = order.tail;
942:                 order.head = 0;
943:                 order.tail = 0;
944:                 // Update bool to indicate batch order is ready to handle claims.
945:                 claim[order.batchId].isReadyForClaim = true;
946:                 // Zero out orders batch id.
947:                 order.batchId = 0;
948:                 // Reset user count.
949:                 order.userCount = 0;
950:                 orderFilled = true;
951:             } else break;
952:         }
```

The `performUpkeep` function needs to be called to fulfill orders that are ITM. It processes the orders one by one by walking through the listed list.

However, the issue is that if the minimum asset requirement is sub-optimal, an attacker could create a large number of orders and add them to the list, which results in the following negative side-effect:

- Legitimate ITM orders not having the chance to be executed if the number of small orders is too large to be realistically cleared within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., Taking 6 months or 12 months to clear)
- Execution of legitimate ITM orders is significantly delayed as it takes some time for the malicious small orders to be processed and cleared from the linked list before reaching the legitimate ITM orders.

## Impact

If the user's order is ITM and not fulfilled due to the DOS attack, the "swap" is not executed, and the user cannot obtain the swapped tokens, leading to a loss of opportunity cost.

Since the ITM orders cannot be fulfilled due to the DOS attack, the users wish to cancel orders. However, it is also not possible to cancel orders that are ITM. Thus, users' assets are stuck in the contract, leading to a loss of assets for the affected users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a new function that allows users to fulfill a single order or a collection of orders without having to walk through the linked list one by one from the `centerHead` or `centerTail`. The fulfilled orders can then be removed from the linked list, and necessary operations could be done to reconnect the linked list. Thus, the existing `performUpkeep` automated operation will not be affected.
