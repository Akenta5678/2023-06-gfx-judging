# The owner can rug pull all wrappedNative token

## Summary

The protocol states in the audit document that owner is restricted and should not be able to steal funds. 
However, there is a `withdrawNative` function in the contract that can extract any wrappedNative token.
The wrappedNative may be one token that makes up the LP. When fulfillOrder, both tokens of the lp are kept in the contract. If the owner takes all wrappedNative, the user funds are not guaranteed to be safe.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function withdrawNative() external onlyOwner {
        uint256 wrappedNativeBalance = WRAPPED_NATIVE.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 nativeBalance = address(this).balance;
        // Make sure there is something to withdraw.
        if (wrappedNativeBalance == 0 && nativeBalance == 0) revert LimitOrderRegistry__ZeroNativeBalance();

        // transfer wrappedNativeBalance if it exists
        if (wrappedNativeBalance > 0) WRAPPED_NATIVE.safeTransfer(owner, wrappedNativeBalance);
        // transfer nativeBalance if it exists
        if (nativeBalance > 0) owner.safeTransferETH(nativeBalance);
    }
```

As you can see from the code, there are no restrictions

## Impact

The Owner can rug pull all wrappedNative tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The contract should maintain an amount of wrappedNative to be extracted by the user, preventing the owner rug pull
